Column C contains translations by Google Translate. Column D contains translations (corrections) by two Chinese students and Xin-Ying Ren.

- Use the translations from column D, if available.
- If no translation available in column D (which means that Google Translate has been found correct), then use column C.
- If column D contains a question mark ('?'), do not use column C. For the time being the term concerned is not clear, without context. More time is needed to investigate what the term exactly means.
